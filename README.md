# Covid-19 Estimator

This assessment empowers me to attempt helping society and leaders prepare for the real rig problem of COVID-19, which is its impact on lives, our health systems, and the economy.

# Getting started

This project contains frontend implementation for the covid-19 Estimator project.

###Problems solved

- Too many patients, not enough hospitals and beds. A serious shortage of ventilators, masks
  and other PPE if we don ºt practice extreme social distancing.
- Job losses or freezes, low cash flow and low production of essentials like food, from too
  many being sick or people caring for their sick loved ones.
